Library Management System &#x1F4D2;


This project is a Library Management System built using Spring Boot, designed to streamline the management of books and authors. The system allows users to efficiently handle library operations through a robust backend architecture.

Features:
Book Management: Add, update, delete, and view detailed information about books, including titles, genres, and publication years.
Author Management: Maintain records of authors with their biographies, names, and the books they've authored.
Search Functionality: Enable users to search for books or authors using various filters.
REST APIs: Implement a set of secure and scalable RESTful APIs for managing library resources.
Database Integration: Use a relational database (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL) to store and manage data effectively.
Technology Stack:
Backend Framework: Spring Boot for developing a scalable and maintainable backend application.
Data Access: Spring Data JPA for ORM and database interaction.
Security: Spring Security for authentication and authorization.
Testing: JUnit and Mockito for robust application testing.
This project demonstrates effective use of Spring Boot's capabilities to build a robust and modular application for managing library operations.
